# IMGD5010 Assignment 2

The image generated will be remeniscent of a beehive. It will encompass hexagons which are arranged in a grid pattern so that they attach to each other perfectly. Each hexagon will be filled with a random shade of orange. The shade of orange will differ with each different hexagon. The entire image will look like the inside of a beehive with a honeycomb pattern.
