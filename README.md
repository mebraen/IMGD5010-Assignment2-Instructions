# IMGD5010 Assignment 2
Below are instructions written in English to create a static visual composition, which I then realized through code in P5JS. The inspiration for these instructions came from my want for a challenge. P5JS has a lot of built in functions, but there is no function to draw a hexagon, which made this a fun challenge for me. The P5JS code can be found in the honeycomb.js file.
## Instructions
The image generated will be remeniscent of a beehive. It will encompass hexagons which are arranged in a grid pattern so that they attach to each other perfectly. Each hexagon will be filled with a random shade of orange. The shade of orange will differ with each different hexagon. The entire image will look like the inside of a beehive with a honeycomb pattern.
## Image
Below is the image that the code generates:
